# Intro
This is my custom leechblock page, which is to display the number of visit attempts to the blocked sites using simple javascript.

# What is LeechBlock?
LeechBlock is a simple productivity tool: an extension for the Firefox web browser designed to block those time-wasting sites that can suck the life out of your working day.  All you need to do is specify which sites to block and when to block them.
